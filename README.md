Welcome to the official repository of the Edzorblaw Clone Project. This project represents the culmination of an internship assignment, demonstrating proficiency in web development. The objective was to meticulously replicate the Edzorblaw website while ensuring responsiveness across diverse devices.

The code uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, prioritizing maintainability, readability, and efficiency.

The website has been designed to deliver an optimal viewing experience across a spectrum of devices, including iPad and 
Laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

Interactive components have been implemented to replicate the user experience of the original website, resulting in a seamless and engaging browsing experience.
